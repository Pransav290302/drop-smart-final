Global rules:
- Always read/consult docs/DropSmart_PRD.md before making architecture decisions.
- Never invent features outside the PRD.
- Every time you generate code, it must be:
  - Complete and ready to run (no TODOs, no pseudo, no '...').
  - Aligned with: FastAPI backend, Streamlit frontend, ML models (LightGBM, Logistic Regression, clustering, embeddings), Docker, CSV export.
- If something is ambiguous in the PRD, ask the user a clarification question.
- Respect all functional requirements (FR-1 to FR-20) and performance constraints (10k SKUs < 30 sec, CPU-only)."
